We will use https://aws-ia.github.io/taskcat/[taskcat] tool to package and upload the code artifacts. Taskcat is a tool that will build and bundle the CFN template into an S3 Bucket which users can then use to spin up their cloudformation stack.

The configuration for the taskcat tool is present in the `.taskcat.yml` in the root of the project directory. 

** Example `.taskcat.yml` configuration

[TIP]
====
The .taskcat.yml file must be updated with the correct regions where you want to deploy your stack. This is crucial as the template will be built specifically for those regions.
====

** For AWS GovCloud deployment, update the regions section:
+
[source, yaml]
----
    regions:
      - us-gov-west-1  # AWS GovCloud (US-West)
      - us-gov-east-1  # AWS GovCloud (US-East)
----
+

** For China Region deployment, update the regions section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    regions:
      - cn-north-1     # China (Beijing)
      - cn-northwest-1 # China (Ningxia)
